# OAuth2

OAuth2 enables developers to build applications that utilize data from the StreamElements API.

*Apply for OAuth2 credentials [here.](https://strms.net/oauth2_request)*
*Code samples are available [here.](https://github.com/StreamElements/authentication-samples)*

|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| https://api.streamelements.com/oauth2/authorize    | Authorization endpoint    |
| https://api.streamelements.com/oauth2/token        | Token endpoint            |

## Authorization Code Grant

Description:

| Parameter         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                             |
|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **client_id**     | string | true     | Your registered client ID                                                               |
| **redirect_uri**  | URI    | true     | Your registered redirect URI.                                                           |
| **response_type** | string | true     | this must be **code**                                                                   |
| **scope**         | string | false    | Space-separated list of scopes                                                          |
| **state**         | string | false    | A unique token generated by your application. This value is echoed back in the response |

Authorization URL Example

```text
https://api.streamelements.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=9d5422b8ff529d420&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foauth.it-really.rocks%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=channel%3Aread
```

When someone navigates to this URL, they will be authorized for the requested scopes. Once accepted they will be
redirected to your *redirect_uri*, which will contain a code and state if specified.

Redirect URL Example

```text
https://oauth.it-really.rocks?code=hjqkweSNDSDQ2___12&state=ejlkqwj2u31u31i1
```

The code is now exchanged for a user access token by making a POST request to the token URL with the following payload.

| Parameter     | Description                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| client_id     | Your registered client ID         |
| client_secret | Your registered client Secret     |
| grant_type    | This must be *authorization_code* |
| code          | The code from the OAuth callback. |
| redirect_uri  | Your registered redirect URI.     |
